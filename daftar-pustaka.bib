   abstract = {Sugarcane harvesters, which can automatically adjust the base-cutter height according to the topography, have attracted increasing interest. Existing ground probing approaches mainly rely on contact machineries, which exhibit slow responses and damage sugarcane plants. This paper presents a rapid and non-contact terrain sensing method using ground penetrating radar (GPR) to realise the automatic height control of the base-cutter. In this study, a 1.6-GHz air-coupled GPR antenna was first mounted on a knockdown roller to measure the vertical distance between the ground and the antenna. The geographic relationship between the detection height and cutter cylinder length was established, based on which the base-cutter height was adjusted by changing the cylinder length. The obtained GPR signal was analysed to locate the ground surface. Post-process techniques were used to enhance the GPR signal contrast between the air and ground layer. To evaluate the penetrating ability and accuracy of the GPR method, sugarcane stalks were densely placed on the soil surface to mimic the extreme conditions of sugarcane fields. The influences of the height/depth of respective highlands/potholes, slope of the ground, and the moisture content of the soil on the GPR imaging were systematically investigated. The numerical and laboratory results confirmed the high accuracy of the proposed GPR method. Hence, a field experiment was conducted, and the soil surface was clearly visualised by GPR imaging. This study demonstrates the significant potential of the GPR-based method for the detection of a sugarcane field surface, which verifies its feasibility for use in manufactured automatic sugarcane harvesters.},

@article{Godio2016,
   abstract = {We have performed extensive georadar surveys for mapping the snow depth in the basin of Breuil-Cervinia (Aosta Valley) in the Italian Alps, close to the Matterhorn. More than 9 km of georadar profiles were acquired in April 2008 and 15 km in April 2009, distributed on an hydrological basin of about 12 km2. Radar surveys were carried out partially on the iced area of Ventina glacier at elevation higher than 3000 m a.s.l. and partially at lower elevation (2500 m-3000 m) on the gently slopes of the basin where the winter snow accumulated directly on the ground surface.The snow distribution on the basin, at the end of the season, could vary significantly according to the elevation range, exposition and ground morphology. In small catchment the snow depth reached 6-7 m. At higher elevation, on the glacier, a more homogeneous distribution is usually observed. A descriptive statistical analysis of the dataset is discussed to demonstrate the high spatial variability of the snow depth distribution in the area. The probability distribution of the snow depth fits the gamma distribution with a good correlation. Instead we didn't found any satisfactory relationship of the snow depth with the main morphological parameters of the terrain (elevation, slope, curvature). This suggests that the snow distribution, at the end of the winter season, is mainly conditioned by the transport phenomena and re-distribution of the wind action. The comparison of the results of georadar surveys with the hand probe measurements points out the low accuracy of the snow depth estimate in the area by using conventional hand probing approach only, encouraging to develop technology for fast and accurate mapping of the snow depth at the scale of basin.},

   abstract = {To identify voids around underground concrete sewer pipes, a few studies have introduced conducting in-pipe Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) inspection systems along the pipes. However, less research has focused on studying the implications of emission, propagation, and reception of electromagnetic waves in the enclosed environment of sewer pipes and their subsequent impact on the resulting radargrams. We defined simulation scenarios where we examine the influence of longitudinal and rotational survey types, antenna frequency, air–gap between antenna and sewer wall, antenna separation, and pipe wall's mirroring effect on the resulting radargrams. Our results encourage practical considerations for designing in-pipe GPR surveys and outline the subsequent steps for automating the in-pipe GPR surveys.},
